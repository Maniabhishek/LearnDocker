## CONTAINER 
- Provides an isolated environment
- can be stopped & restarted
- is just a process but a special process which has its file system which is provided by images
- if you run a container of ubuntu and have some file created in any folder and you again open another container of ubuntu in another teminal you will not be able to see those file that were created in other container , anything done in one container will be invisible to other container , each container creates an isolated environment

## Dockerfile (some important dockerfile instructions for building an image)
- FROM (specifying the base image, we take that base image which contains bunch of files and directories and build image on top of that)
- WORKDIR (working directory once we specify this , all the following command will be executed from working directory)
- COPY
- ADD
- RUN (we can run all the linux command using RUN instructions)
- ENV (for setting up environment variables)
- EXPOSE (for specfying the container starting on specific port)
- USER (specifying the user should run the applications)
- CMD (specifying the command when we start the container)
- ENTRYPOINT


## choosing the right base image
- we need to choose the correct base image for example go,or node any application you are working on
- once we choose and add the instruction using FROM eg., ```FROM golang:1.21.3-alpine3.18 AS build```
- now to create the image use commad ```docker build -t go-simple-app .``` -t for tagging the image and . to tell docker where is the Dockerfile which is the current directory
- now to see the docker use ```docker image ls``` and to run use command ```docker run -it (interactive) go-simple-app```
- now if you run the above command docker run , you will see go terminal but what if want to to bash shell or sh shell terminal, then use command ```docker run -it go-simple-app bash``` now you might get an error saying that module not found , its because the alpine that you downloaded wouldn't have bash so, use ```docker run -it go-simple-app sh```


## copying files and directories 
- ``` dokcer build -t go-simple-app . ``` look at the last argument which is "." , so when we execute this command , docker client sends the content of this directory to docker engine this is called build context so docker client sends the build context to docker enginer and then docker engine will start executing the instruction from dockerfile one by one
- ``` COPY package.json /app ``` this insctruction will copy package.json to /app directory so if /app directory doesn't exist docker will automatically create it
- for multiple files to copy ```  COPY package.json README.md /app/ ``` if copying multiple files then directory name should end with / (i.e., /app/)
- we can also use patterns ``` COPY package*.json /app/ ```
- what if we want to copy the entire file and folder in the current directory then use period (.) ```COPY . /app/```
- let's discuss about the destination , we are using absolute path, but we can also use relative path just use one instruction ```WORKDIR /app``` so all the instruction coming after this will be executed inside this directory
- so we can now change previous COPY command COPY . .
- what if you want to copy a files which  has space in it we can use array of string , where elements of the array will act the arguments ```COPY ["hello world.txt", "."]```
- we can also use ADD instruction ``` ADD . .``` but with ADD we can have more feature , for example we can copy files from any link or we can copy zipped file (e.g., file.zip )then entire zipped file is unzipped and copied to working directory 
  

## Exclude files or directories
- just like .gitignore we have a file .dockerignore , we can mention file that we dont want the part of image
- there are lot of advantages of including this as , build time will increased , build context size will be decreased
- just include the filder name you dont want it to be part of


## Running Commands 
- now here while copying all the files and and for example we excluded go.sum file then we need to run ```go mod tidy``` for example if node project you run ```npm install```
- use instruction ```RUN go mod tidy``` for node ```RUN npm install```


## Setting Environment variables
- ```ENV API_URL=http://api.myapi.com/ ``` you can use = in the command or you can remove it too using this instruction you will find this variable when you run the container

## Exposing Ports 
- now if you have image when run it, it running on the seperate container , if you try to access it on host you will not be able to do so , to access it you can only do it on container, there can be many container which will use the same image to run, and all the containers are different and will run on the same port so if you try to run it on host it wint work
- but we can map host to container which we will do it later.
- we will use command EXPOSE ```EXPOSE 3000 ``` port this container will be listening to, using EXPOSE will not automatically expose 3000 port on host , it is just a way to document that this container will listen to 3000, so later when we run the container we know the port on host we need to use in order to listen


## setting the user
- ``` docker run -it alpine ``` to add group or user .. addgroup app or for adding user ```adduser -S -G app app ``` -S because we want to add system user just adduser enter for help you will see all the options , and we kept app as user name because that is the best practice to have primary group name same as user name 
- so to do it using docker ```RUN addgroup app && adduser -S -G app app```
- ```USER app``` to set the user , now all the instruction executed after this instruction will be executed by this user


## Defining Entrypoints
- now if you run ```docker run go-simple-app``` it will run the container and stop
- try ```docker run go-simple-app go run .``` or for node ```docker run go-simple-app npm start``` but if you might get error as permission denied for below docker file
  - ```
    FROM golang:1.21.3-alpine3.18 AS build
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .
    RUN go mod tidy
    ENV API_BASE_URL=http://api.myapi.com/
    RUN addgroup app && adduser -S -G app app
    USER app
    ```
- if you see WORKDIR /app is on the line 71 (which will be created through root user) and user app is created at line 76 which mean this user will not execute previlege hence you will get permission denied so just move the code that is creating user
  - ```
    FROM golang:1.21.3-alpine3.18 AS build
    RUN addgroup app && adduser -S -G app app
    USER app
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .
    RUN go mod tidy
    ENV API_BASE_URL=http://api.myapi.com/
    ```
- now we have been running docker using ```docker run go-simple-app npm install``` or ```docker run go-simple-app go run .``` but it is better to use CMD instruction to run a command go run .
- use instruction ```CMD go run .``` in dockerfile now this cmd will be executed only once even if you have multiple CMD then the last one will be executed
- now you might be thinking the difference between RUN and CMD , RUN instruction is build time instruction , used at the time of building the image  , during this instruction we are installing dependencies , on the contrast CMD is run time instruction it is executed when we are starting the construction
- CMD has two forms shell form and Exec form , shell form ```CMD go run .``` which spin up new shell (in linux this shell is /bin/sh , windows cmd) and Exec form is best practice as you dont have to spin up seperate shell , and this way you can clean up resources much faster when container is stopped, so always use the Exec form ```CMD ["go", "run", "."]
- we have another instruction **ENTRYPOINT** now this instruction is similar to **CMD** instruction , with CMD it is very easy to overwrite this instruciton for e.g., when you run ```docker run -it go-simple-app sh``` or ```docker run go-simple-app echo hello``` then echo hello or sh will be executed CMD will not be executed but with ENTRYPOINT instruction it will not be ovderwritten easily unless you pass option ```--entrypoint```  ```docker run go-simple-app --entrypoint ``` so it is little bit harder to overwrite
- so which instruction to use , it is up to you which ever you want you can use
