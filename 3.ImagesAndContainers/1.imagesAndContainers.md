## CONTAINER 
- Provides an isolated environment
- can be stopped & restarted
- is just a process but a special process which has its file system which is provided by images
- if you run a container of ubuntu and have some file created in any folder and you again open another container of ubuntu in another teminal you will not be able to see those file that were created in other container , anything done in one container will be invisible to other container , each container creates an isolated environment

## Dockerfile (some important dockerfile instructions for building an image)
- FROM (specifying the base image, we take that base image which contains bunch of files and directories and build image on top of that)
- WORKDIR (working directory once we specify this , all the following command will be executed from working directory)
- COPY
- ADD
- RUN (we can run all the linux command using RUN instructions)
- ENV (for setting up environment variables)
- EXPOSE (for specfying the container starting on specific port)
- USER (specifying the user should run the applications)
- CMD (specifying the command when we start the container)
- ENTRYPOINT
