## linux comand 

- if we want to pull any image we can use ```docker pull ubuntu ```
- we can also directly use ```docker run ubuntu``` using this command will check if it exists locally , if not then it will pull it behind the scenes and then run the container
- after running the above command, since after runnig the command if you didn't interact with the container, then container will stop
- you can check with ```docker ps``` will list all the process or running container or ```docker ps -a``` to see all the container along with stopped container as well
- we can run ubuntu in an interactive shell using ```docker run -it ubuntu```
- now run the ubuntu in an interactive shell 

## managing packages 
- these days most os , development platform comes with packaging managers such as npm, pip etc.
- in ubuntu we have package manager called ```apt```
- we can use apt in ubuntu to install packages
- for example , if we want to install nano , we will use command ```apt install nano``` we might get error , as this command looks at the package database , it might not find it there , so we need to update
- update using ```apt update```
- so always installing any packages , first update to update your packaging database
- after running ```apt install nano``` if we want to remove it we can use ```apt remove nano```


## Linux file system 
- in windows root directory is c: and other program file,  windows reside inside the c directory
- whereas in linux we have / as the root directory on the top of the hierarchy
- bin, boot , dev , etc , home , root , lib, var, proc
- bin is folder which includes binaries or programs
- boot includes all the files related to booting
- dev (devices) in linux everything is files includig devices, directories, network sockets
- etc (editable text configuration) this where we will have configuration files
- home home directories where users are stored, each users will have home directory
- root this is home directory for the root users , only root users will be able to access it
- lib for library files
- var (variables)
- proc (running processs) so everything in linux is files even process , directories


## Manipulating files and Directories
- mkdir for creating the folder ```mkdir test```
- to rename the folder use ```mv test docker```
- touch to create file (```touch hello.txt```)
- to create multiple files use ```touch file1.txt file2.txt```
- to list the folder use ls or ```ls -1``` to list the file in single file per line
- to rename the file use ```mv hello.txt hello-docker.txt```
- control + w to delete a word in the terminal
- remove multiple file ```rm file1.txt file2.txt``` or use patter ```rm file*```
- to remove directory use ```rm -r directoryname``` -r means recursive


## editing and viewing files
- lets install nano first using ```apt install nano``` (update first using ```apt update```)
- to edit a file use ```nano file1.txt``` control + x to exit and save
- to view the content of file we can use cat ```cat file1.txt``` cat is useful when our file is short
- we can more to view file , it is useful to use when file size is bigger ```more file1.txt```
- but there is a problem with more it will initially show 15% and upon hitting enter you can see next part of the file but you cannot go back to file or previous line
- we can use less to use which is much better , we can use up and down arrow to see the file space to go to next page  ```less file1.txt```
- if we want to see first few lines of the file we can use ```head -n 5 /etc/adduser.conf```
- if we want to see last few lines of the file we can use ```tail -n 5 /etc/adduser.conf```
