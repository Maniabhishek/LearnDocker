## linux comand 

- if we want to pull any image we can use ```docker pull ubuntu ```
- we can also directly use ```docker run ubuntu``` using this command will check if it exists locally , if not then it will pull it behind the scenes and then run the container
- after running the above command, since after runnig the command if you didn't interact with the container, then container will stop
- you can check with ```docker ps``` will list all the process or running container or ```docker ps -a``` to see all the container along with stopped container as well
- we can run ubuntu in an interactive shell using ```docker run -it ubuntu```
- now run the ubuntu in an interactive shell 

## managing packages 
- these days most os , development platform comes with packaging managers such as npm, pip etc.
- in ubuntu we have package manager called ```apt```
- we can use apt in ubuntu to install packages
- for example , if we want to install nano , we will use command ```apt install nano``` we might get error , as this command looks at the package database , it might not find it there , so we need to update
- update using ```apt update```
- so always installing any packages , first update to update your packaging database
- after running ```apt install nano``` if we want to remove it we can use ```apt remove nano```


## Linux file system 
- in windows root directory is c: and other program file,  windows reside inside the c directory
- whereas in linux we have / as the root directory on the top of the hierarchy
- bin, boot , dev , etc , home , root , lib, var, proc
- bin is folder which includes binaries or programs
- boot includes all the files related to booting
- dev (devices) in linux everything is files includig devices, directories, network sockets
- etc (editable text configuration) this where we will have configuration files
- home home directories where users are stored, each users will have home directory
- root this is home directory for the root users , only root users will be able to access it
- lib for library files
- var (variables)
- proc (running processs) so everything in linux is files even process , directories


## Manipulating files and Directories
- mkdir for creating the folder ```mkdir test```
- to rename the folder use ```mv test docker```
- touch to create file (```touch hello.txt```)
- to create multiple files use ```touch file1.txt file2.txt```
- to list the folder use ls or ```ls -1``` to list the file in single file per line
- to rename the file use ```mv hello.txt hello-docker.txt```
- control + w to delete a word in the terminal
- remove multiple file ```rm file1.txt file2.txt``` or use patter ```rm file*```
- to remove directory use ```rm -r directoryname``` -r means recursive


## editing and viewing files
- lets install nano first using ```apt install nano``` (update first using ```apt update```)
- to edit a file use ```nano file1.txt``` control + x to exit and save
- to view the content of file we can use cat ```cat file1.txt``` cat is useful when our file is short
- we can more to view file , it is useful to use when file size is bigger ```more file1.txt```
- but there is a problem with more it will initially show 15% and upon hitting enter you can see next part of the file but you cannot go back to file or previous line
- we can use less to use which is much better , we can use up and down arrow to see the file space to go to next page  ```less file1.txt```
- if we want to see first few lines of the file we can use ```head -n 5 /etc/adduser.conf```
- if we want to see last few lines of the file we can use ```tail -n 5 /etc/adduser.conf```

## Redirection
- one of the standard concept of linux is I/O, standard input represent keyboard and output as screen
- we can always change the source of Input and output this is called redirection
- cat file1.txt will display the output on the screen
- but if we want to redirect the output to another file then we can use ```cat file1.txt > file2.txt``` so we can use cat command to concatenate or combine multiple files
- ```cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt``` to combine the multiple file
- ``` echo hello ``` will display hello on the screen , ```echo hello > file1.txt``` this will write hello inside the file1.txt
- if you want to write a few line to to file then we can use echo command
- if you want to write list of file from /etc file then use ```ls -l /etc > files.txt```

## Searching for Text
- grep (global regular expression print) 
- ```grep hello file.txt``` will find the hello word in hello.txt file
- to search in multiple file ```grep hello file1.txt file2.txt```
- we can pattern to search in all the files ```grep hello file*```
- we can search the entire folder ```grep -i -r hello /etc``` -i to ignore case sensitive -r recursive as it is folder
- ```grep -i -r hello .```


## find files and directories
- ```find``` command show all the files and directories in current directories (also lists the hidden files )
- ls does the same but it doesn't show the hidden files to see the hidden files use ```ls -a ```
- find ```find /etc``` displays all the files inside /etc
- to find only the directories ```find -type d```
- alternatively to find only the files ```find -type f```
- to find file with name ```find -type f -name "f*"
- to make the above case insensitive ```find -type f -iname "F*"
- ```find / -type f -iname "*.py" > pythonfiles.py``` command to find all the python files in current directory and write it to pythonfiles.py


## Chaining Commands
- we can chain multiple commands ```mkdir hello ; cd hello ; echo hello ``` so this command will run first mkdir hello , it will create the directory and then cd hello , we are now in hello directory and then finally echoes hello
- what if we again execute the same above command in same directory then for first it will throw error and then it will go on to execute cd hello and enters into the hello directory and then echoes hello
- but what if we want error to throw if first commands throws and then we dont want other command to be executed then we can use **&&** here is the command ```mkdir hello && cd hello && echo hello``` so if mkdir hello is executed and if it throws error then other command will not be executed
- we can also use || (or) command ```mkdir hello || echo "directory exists"``` so if mkdir runs then echo will not and if mkdir fails echo will be executed
- now this command  ```mkdir hello ; cd hello ; echo hello ``` we can write it in more readable form using the next line shown below
- ```mkdir hello;\ (hit enter) cd hello;\ (hit enter) echo hello```
- we can also do piping of the command ``` ls /bin | less``` ```ls /bin | head``` ```ls /bin | tail```
- ```ls /bin | head -n 5```
