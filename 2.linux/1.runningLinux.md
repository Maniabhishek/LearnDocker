## linux comand 

- if we want to pull any image we can use ```docker pull ubuntu ```
- we can also directly use ```docker run ubuntu``` using this command will check if it exists locally , if not then it will pull it behind the scenes and then run the container
- after running the above command, since after runnig the command if you didn't interact with the container, then container will stop
- you can check with ```docker ps``` will list all the process or running container or ```docker ps -a``` to see all the container along with stopped container as well
- we can run ubuntu in an interactive shell using ```docker run -it ubuntu```
- now run the ubuntu in an interactive shell 

## managing packages 
- these days most os , development platform comes with packaging managers such as npm, pip etc.
- in ubuntu we have package manager called ```apt```
- we can use apt in ubuntu to install packages
- for example , if we want to install nano , we will use command ```apt install nano``` we might get error , as this command looks at the package database , it might not find it there , so we need to update
- update using ```apt update```
- so always installing any packages , first update to update your packaging database
- after running ```apt install nano``` if we want to remove it we can use ```apt remove nano```


## Linux file system 
- in windows root directory is c: and other program file,  windows reside inside the c directory
- whereas in linux we have / as the root directory on the top of the hierarchy
- bin, boot , dev , etc , home , root , lib, var, proc
- bin is folder which includes binaries or programs
- boot includes all the files related to booting
- dev (devices) in linux everything is files includig devices, directories, network sockets
- etc (editable text configuration) this where we will have configuration files
- home home directories where users are stored, each users will have home directory
- root this is home directory for the root users , only root users will be able to access it
- lib for library files
- var (variables)
- proc (running processs) so everything in linux is files even process , directories


## Manipulating files and Directories
- mkdir for creating the folder ```mkdir test```
- to rename the folder use ```mv test docker```
- touch to create file (```touch hello.txt```)
- to create multiple files use ```touch file1.txt file2.txt```
- to list the folder use ls or ```ls -1``` to list the file in single file per line
- to rename the file use ```mv hello.txt hello-docker.txt```
- control + w to delete a word in the terminal
- remove multiple file ```rm file1.txt file2.txt``` or use patter ```rm file*```
- to remove directory use ```rm -r directoryname``` -r means recursive


## editing and viewing files
- lets install nano first using ```apt install nano``` (update first using ```apt update```)
- to edit a file use ```nano file1.txt``` control + x to exit and save
- to view the content of file we can use cat ```cat file1.txt``` cat is useful when our file is short
- we can more to view file , it is useful to use when file size is bigger ```more file1.txt```
- but there is a problem with more it will initially show 15% and upon hitting enter you can see next part of the file but you cannot go back to file or previous line
- we can use less to use which is much better , we can use up and down arrow to see the file space to go to next page  ```less file1.txt```
- if we want to see first few lines of the file we can use ```head -n 5 /etc/adduser.conf```
- if we want to see last few lines of the file we can use ```tail -n 5 /etc/adduser.conf```

## Redirection
- one of the standard concept of linux is I/O, standard input represent keyboard and output as screen
- we can always change the source of Input and output this is called redirection
- cat file1.txt will display the output on the screen
- but if we want to redirect the output to another file then we can use ```cat file1.txt > file2.txt``` so we can use cat command to concatenate or combine multiple files
- ```cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt``` to combine the multiple file
- ``` echo hello ``` will display hello on the screen , ```echo hello > file1.txt``` this will write hello inside the file1.txt
- if you want to write a few line to to file then we can use echo command
- if you want to write list of file from /etc file then use ```ls -l /etc > files.txt```

## Searching for Text
- grep (global regular expression print) 
- ```grep hello file.txt``` will find the hello word in hello.txt file
- to search in multiple file ```grep hello file1.txt file2.txt```
- we can pattern to search in all the files ```grep hello file*```
- we can search the entire folder ```grep -i -r hello /etc``` -i to ignore case sensitive -r recursive as it is folder
- ```grep -i -r hello .```


## find files and directories
- ```find``` command show all the files and directories in current directories (also lists the hidden files )
- ls does the same but it doesn't show the hidden files to see the hidden files use ```ls -a ```
- find ```find /etc``` displays all the files inside /etc
- to find only the directories ```find -type d```
- alternatively to find only the files ```find -type f```
- to find file with name ```find -type f -name "f*"
- to make the above case insensitive ```find -type f -iname "F*"
- ```find / -type f -iname "*.py" > pythonfiles.py``` command to find all the python files in current directory and write it to pythonfiles.py


## Chaining Commands
- we can chain multiple commands ```mkdir hello ; cd hello ; echo hello ``` so this command will run first mkdir hello , it will create the directory and then cd hello , we are now in hello directory and then finally echoes hello
- what if we again execute the same above command in same directory then for first it will throw error and then it will go on to execute cd hello and enters into the hello directory and then echoes hello
- but what if we want error to throw if first commands throws and then we dont want other command to be executed then we can use **&&** here is the command ```mkdir hello && cd hello && echo hello``` so if mkdir hello is executed and if it throws error then other command will not be executed
- we can also use || (or) command ```mkdir hello || echo "directory exists"``` so if mkdir runs then echo will not and if mkdir fails echo will be executed
- now this command  ```mkdir hello ; cd hello ; echo hello ``` so imagine this command was very longer, we can write it in more readable form using the next line shown below
- ```mkdir hello;\ (hit enter) cd hello;\ (hit enter) echo hello```
- we can also do piping of the command ``` ls /bin | less``` ```ls /bin | head``` ```ls /bin | tail```
- ```ls /bin | head -n 5```


## Environment variables
- environment variable which we can use to store configuration settings or application settings
- ```printenv ``` will give you all the env variable set in your system
- you will see PATH variable where all the configuration path will be stored for any application you install , sometime you might notice that even after installing the application you might get error that command not found that's because you might not have set the path, this variable will colon seperated values
- to view a particular variable use ```printenv PATH``` (this is case sensitive)
- we can also use echo to view environment variable , just prefix $ with the variable```echo $PATH```
- How to set a variable , using export command ```export DB_USER=abhi``` then use ```printenv DB_USER``` or ```echo $DB_USER```
- but the above variable will be present only in the current session , if we close the current sesstion we will not get the values back
- so to store it go to root directory ```cd ~``` or ```cd ~/.```
- do ```ls -a ``` you will find .bashrc file, this is a configuration file for the bash shell, this is user's personal startup file, so everytime user logs in linux loads this these commands from users home directory, so this is where we have to write permanent environment variables
- we can edit the file using ```nano .bashrc```
- let's edit using another technique ```echo DB_USER=abhi >> .bashrc``` always two greater than sign to append using one will overwrite the file, now we can access DB_USER anytime even after closing the session
- now again if we want to export another variable ```echo APPNAME=google >> .bashrc``` and if we try ```echo $APPNAME``` we will not see anything , we need either restart the session or refresh the bashrc file using ```source .bashrc``` for this command you have to be in root directory or use ```source ~/.bashrc``` from any directory ~ means home directory
- so when you create a new env variable inside .bashrc file then you will have to use either source .bashrc to refresh or you can restart the session if running in docker ```exit``` then again start the container so find out the running container using ```docker ps -a``` copy containerId and then run command ```docker start -i {{containerId}}```
 

## Managing Process 
- A process is an instance of a running program
- to see all the processes running use ```ps``` command
- bash is short form of bourne-again shell , it's the program that is interacting here in terminal, a program that takes our command and sends it to linux for execution
- ps commands gives you list of processes running if you want kill any process then use ```kill {{PID}}```
- let use run command ```sleep 100 &```
- then run ```ps```
- you will find sleep running then simply copy the PID of sleep and run command ```kill {{PID}}```


## Managing Users 
- useradd (to add a user), usermod (to modify a user) , userdel (to delete a user)
- ```useradd``` followed by enter , to see the options with  useradd (eg., -m --create-home, create the user's home directory)
- ```useradd testuserA``` to create home directory for testuserA
- where can we find the user information or where is it stored , ```cat /etc/passwd ``` users information are stored in the passwd directory (password are not stored here directly) we only user account information
- after running the above ```useradd testuserA``` and finding users account information using ```cat /etc/passwd``` you will see ```testuserA:x:1000:1000::/home/testuserA:/bin/sh``` testuserA is the username and x is the password which is not stored here , 1000 is the account id and next 1000 is the group id then we have home directory for user(/home/testuserA) and then bin/sh is the shell program used by this user. bin/sh represents old original shell program but we also have bash
- but what we want , when we login ,instead of using shell (sh) we want to use bash
- so we will now use usermod to update this record with shell as bash 
- usermod hit enter to see the options available ```usermod -s /bin/bash testuserA```
- now where is the password stored it's in the same directory ```/etc/shadow``` password is stored in encrypted form
- if we want to login as new user testuserA in another session , ```docker ps -a ``` use command ```docker exec -it -u testuserA {{containerID}} bash``` now you will see $ sign instead of # as testuserA is not root user now try to use command ```cat /etc/shadow``` you will see access denied which confirm that you are not root user
- if you hit ```cd ~``` which will take you to the home directory for the testuserA ``` /root/testuserA``` now if you want to delete we can delete using ```userdel testuserA```
- we worked with useradd , we also have adduser ```adduser bob``` now this is more interactive it will prompt you give password and some other info , and it by default adds user to the group


## Managing groups
- groupadd (to add user to a group) , groupmod (to modify a group), groupdel (to delete a group)
- ```groupadd developers``` (we can check the groups in ```cat /etc/group```)
- to find out the options with groupadd , type groupadd followed by enter
- you will see many options -g(force use GROUP as new primary group) and -G (new list of supplementary groups) in linux every user has one primary group and 0 or more supplementary groups
- what's the difference , lets say john is part 5 group and wants to create a file every file is owned by one group and one user if john is part of 5 group, which group should we use for owning that file which john is going to create , that's why we need primary group , primary group is created when automatically when we create user , it's the group with the same name as user
- so we will use -G to add supplementary group for testuserA
- ```usermod -G developers testuserA```
- we can see in the file /etc/passwd use command , ```cat /etc/passwd | grep testuserA``` or ```grep testuserA /etc/passwd```
- if we want to find out what group tesuserA has , use command ```groups testuserA```
- to add user to multiple groups we can use -a option, lets first create a new group artists using command ```groupdadd artists``` and then we can testuserA to this group using command ```usermod -aG artists testuserA```
