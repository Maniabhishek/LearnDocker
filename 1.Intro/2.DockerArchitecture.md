## let's understand how docker works 
- it works on client server architecture it has client component and server component where client communicates with the server with REST API , server also known as DOCKER engine , which sits on the backend and is responsible for builing and running docker containers
- Containers are basically process , just like other process running on your computer, but it is different kind of process
- unlike VM, containers doesn't takes up host hardware, all the containers running on the host , shares the hardware on same host , it doesn't need dedicated resources .
- More Precisely all the containers uses the Kernel of the hosts, A kernel that manages applications and hardware resources
- since all the OS has its own kernel , which is why we can't run application which runs on windows on mac or vice versa ,
- so on a linux machine we can only run Linux containers, on windows we can run both linux and windows containers because windows 10 has custom build linux kernel, in mac os kernel it is different than windows or linux kernel, and its kernel doesn't have native support for containers, in mac docker uses lightweight linux VM to run the containers


## Development workflow 
- any application we have , we add one file in our workflow which is dockerfile, which is a plain text file that includes instruction that docker uses package of this application in to images
- an image contains everything our application needs to run , A cut down OS, a runtime environment(eg Node), application files, third party libraries, environment variables
- so we create dockerfile and give it docker to packaging our application into an image
- once we have image we ask docker to create a container using that image, container is just a proccess , but with its on file system which is provided by the image so our applicaiton is loaded inside a container or a process , so that is how we run application locally
- so we create image on the dev and then push it to docker resigtery or the docker hub , it is same as github to git , and then from there any one can pull it and can run
