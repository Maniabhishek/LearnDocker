## let's understand how docker works 
- it works on client server architecture it has client component and server component where client communicates with the server with REST API , server also known as DOCKER engine , which sits on the backend and is responsible for builing and running docker containers
- Containers are basically process , just like other process running on your computer, but it is different kind of process
- unlike VM, containers doesn't takes up host hardware, all the containers running on the host , shares the hardware on same host , it doesn't need dedicated resources .
- More Precisely all the containers uses the Kernel of the hosts, A kernel that manages applications and hardware resources
- since all the OS has its own kernel , which is why we can't run application which runs on windows on mac or vice versa ,
- so on a linux machine we can only run Linux containers, on windows we can run both linux and windows containers because windows 10 has custom build linux kernel, in mac os kernel it is different than windows or linux kernel, and its kernel doesn't have native support for containers, in mac docker uses lightweight linux VM to run the containers
