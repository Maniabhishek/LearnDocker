## Docker ?
- A platform for building, running, and shipping applications

## Container
- An isolated environment for running an application


## How are containers different from virtual machine?
- Virtual machine are abstraction of a machine (physical hardware)
- on mac , we can run windows or linux with the help of hypervisors , there are many hypervisors for e.g., virtualBox, VMware, Hyper-v only for windows
- how can we utilize virtual machine as developer, we can run applications in completely isolated environment for example one app can use node 14 in one VM and another can use node 9 in another VM
- but having multiple VM comes with cost
  - Each VM needs a full-blown OS
  - Slow to start
  - Resource intensive
- where as containers
  - Allow running multiple apps in isolation
  - are lightweight
  - Use os of the host
  - start quickly
  - Need less hardware resources
